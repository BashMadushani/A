Project Workflow 
1. Identifying the Problem: Clearly define your research problem or question. 
2. Data Understanding 
Data Collection: Obtain data from reliable sources. 
Data Exploration: 
o Get an initial overview of the data. 
o Calculate summary statistics. 
o Visualize data. 
o Identify issues such as outliers, missing values, or duplicates. 
3. Data Preprocessing 
Cleaning: Remove inconsistencies and errors. 
o Remove incorrect/incomplete data. 
o Apply binning (mean/median/boundary smoothing). 
o Regression, clustering. 
o Handle missing values using median, mean, or mode. 
Reduction: 
o Dimensionality reduction. 
o Attribute subset selection. 
o Numerosity reduction (sampling or modeling). 
Transformation: 
o Normalize data. 
o Feature selection & engineering. 
o Discretization. 
o Concept hierarchy generation. 
4. Data Mining & Machine Learning 
o Apply data mining tasks/methods. 
o Evaluate models/patterns. 
o Iterate: 
• Try different parameter settings. 
• Try alternative methods. 
• Improve preprocessing or features. 
• Increase data quantity or quality. 
5. Evaluation & Interpretation 
o Results: Present findings clearly. 
o Validation: Understand performance and reliability. 
• Performance metrics. 
• Cross-validation. 
• Model selection & hyperparameter tuning. 
• Address overfitting and underfitting.
